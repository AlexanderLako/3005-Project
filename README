Instructions to install and set up environment:

BEFORE YOU RUN (having python is required):

First you need to install psycopg2
Open a terminal where the project is located by cloning the repository
Type "pip install psycopg2" in the terminakl
Note: DO NOT try to install in VScode, it will not work

Next, open pgAdmin, create a database called '3005Project'

There are two options in order to connect to the database;

1)
  Locate the application.py SQLpassword variable located at the top of the file
  Modify it to reflect the password you used to connect to the server
  SQLusername should be 'postgres'

2)
  The other option, is to create a new login for that database.
  If you want to do that, right click on Login/group roles and create a new login/group role.
  Create a name and password for this user.
  Give the user the necessary permissions in order to login (I recommend making them a superuser and allow login)
  Then modify the SQLusername and SQLpassword to reflect the new user




Instructions to run program:

  1) Create the database using the command "Python3 create_database.py" in the terminal
     which runs the script to create the database and inserts some tuples

  2) Run the application script using the command "Python3 application.py" in the terminal

  3) When the application is open, answer the prompts by typing in either 1, 2, 3, etc. as specified and pressing Enter
     to test functionality.

  4) Check the updated relations in PGAdmin to see any changes to the database




Use Cases:
  - Querying orders and tracking info for existing orders as a customer
  - Register a new user and logging in with that username
  - Placing an order as a registered user by adding books to the cart
  - Search the catalogue by ISBN, genre, author, book name
  - Checking reports (sales vs. expenditure, genre sales, author sales) as an owner
  - Adding and removing books as an owner

  Note that some error checks are not implemented (ex. handling invalid inputs)
