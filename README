  BEFORE YOU RUN:

  First you need to install psycopg2
  Open a terminal where the project is located
  Type "pip install psycopg2" 
  Note: DO NOT try to install in VScode, it will not work

  Next, open pgAdmin, create a database called '3005Project'

  There are two options in order to connect to the database;

1)
  Locate the project_3005.py SQLpassword variable located at the top of the file
  Modify it to reflect the password you used to connect to the server
  SQLusername should be 'postgres'

2)
  The other option, is to create a new login for that database.
  If you want to do that, right click on Login/group roles and create a new login/group role.
  Create a name and password for this user.
  Give the user the necessary permissions in order to login (I recommend making them a superuser and allow login)
  Then modify the SQLusername and SQLpassword to reflect the new user
  


  Instructions to run program:

  Run the project_3005.py script (with modifications made from above)
  Answer prompts by typing in either 1, 2, 3, etc. as specified and pressing Enter


Use Cases:
  - Querying tracking info for existing orders as a customer

  - Search the catalogue by ISBN, genre, author, book name
  - Checking reports (sales vs. expenditure, genre sales, author sales) as an owner
  - Adding and removing books as an owner

  Note that error checks are not implemented (ex. handling invalid inputs)
